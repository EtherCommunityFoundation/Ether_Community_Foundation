                <p>Through the development concept of "Six Communist Parties" that everyone agrees, everyone creates, everyone builds, everyone governs, everyone shares and everyone wins, all the members who join the ether ecological community are the shareholders
                    of the ether ecological community.
                </p>
                <p>An isolated project may create a product that disrupts the industry, but through collaboration we can create a framework that will change the world. </p>

            <h1>The relationship between community and ecological development</h1>
            <div class="community_title">
                <p>The goal of community is to unify community strength and expand consensus. The foundation of ecological development lies in the deepening, consolidation and expansion of project consensus. Therefore, community governance and ecological
                    development are interdependent.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>(1) Community consensus needs cohesion and expansion of ecological development</h3>
            <div class="community_title">
                <p>Community consensus is dynamic and developing, and ecological development will lead to the deepening and expansion of project consensus. Therefore, community consensus needs the cohesion and expansion of ecological development.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>(2) Ecological development needs community consensus promotion and improvement</h3>
            <div class="community_title">
                <p>Eco-development is not a purely spontaneous process, but requires contributions from community members, whether intentional or unintentional. Especially in the case of public chain competition, it needs the integration of community strength
                    and interests.</p>

                        of the project.</p>
                    <p>We don't set up community rules, we only provide guidelines. Anyone can join, anyone can participate. We voted on these guidelines to guide the project forward.</p>
